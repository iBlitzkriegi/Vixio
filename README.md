2. Download the latest version of [Vixio](https://github.com/iBlitzkriegi/Vixio/releases)

# Setup

To use Vixio, you must first have a bot on your Discord server. To do so, follow the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/AXGETouUzoo) or the instructions below:

- Go to [discord's application dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and click on "New Application". You may have to login!
- Give the application a name under "App Name" then in the bottom right click "Create Application".
- You should now see your new applicaion. Next, under "App Details" click on "Create a bot user".
- Click "Yes, do it" on the conformation screen.
- Under "App Bot User" find "Token" and click "Click to reveal" and save the token. That's what you will use to log in to your bot when Vixio starts
- Next, find the "Client ID" at the top of the page.
- Replace the X's with the client ID in this URL: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXX&scope=bot&permissions=0 
    - You can give that link to anyone so they can add it to their guild. 

- Now, in a skript add this:
```
on skript load:
        login to user with token "BOT TOKEN HERE" with name "NAME OF BOT HERE"
```
(or using a trigger of your choice)

You can now reference your bot from any skript at any time.
